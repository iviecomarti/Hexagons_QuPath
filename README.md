Multiple scripts to obtain hexagonal grids in QuPath


Hey!

I found myself in the problem to trim my Whole Slide Images into hexagons. After reading this post in [ image.sc forum ](https://forum.image.sc/t/hexagonal-grid-roi-macro/31465/2) I understood how to do it and adapted it to work in QuPath. I modified the original script to be able to use the hexagonal trimming for different purposes. 

Here you can see the discussion in image.sc


I hope that those scripts could be usefull for you all!

If you use it, please cite this repository:
